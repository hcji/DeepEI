## DeepEI

This is the repository of codes for the paper entitled "Predicting molecular fingerprint from electronâˆ’ionization mass spectrum with deep neural networks" (submit). This repository only contains the source codes **without** any data or pretrained models, due to the models were trained by NIST dataset.

We exported each mass spectrum file (msp file) and molecular file (sdf) from NIST 2017 manually and save to db file (see *scripts/NIST2DB.py* for codes), firstly. When training we retrieved information from the db file.

DeepEI contain two main parts: 1. Predicting molecular fingerprint from EI-MS (*Fingerprint* folder); 2. Predicting retention index from structure (*retention* folder). Each folder contains the codes for data pretreatment, model training and model selection.

Moreover, the *scripts* folder contains the scripts for convert NIST database to numpy object; the *Discussion* folder contains the scripts for evaluating the identification performance, and comparing with [NEIMS](https://github.com/brain-research/deep-molecular-massspec) package. The corresponding results are also included.
